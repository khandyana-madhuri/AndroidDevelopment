# WeatherApp
- When the app is launched, it requests the user's location.
- It then fetches the current weather using a weather API.
- Users can also search for the weather of a specific city.
- The app's background dynamically changes based on the weather conditions received from the API. For example, if itâ€™s rainy, the background will reflect a rainy theme.
